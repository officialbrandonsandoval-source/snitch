# npm resolution error report

While resolving: snitch@1.9.1
Found: @react-navigation/native@6.1.18
node_modules/@react-navigation/native
  @react-navigation/native@"6.1.18" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @react-navigation/native@"^7.1.20" from @react-navigation/native-stack@7.6.3
node_modules/@react-navigation/native-stack
  @react-navigation/native-stack@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
