# npm resolution error report

While resolving: snitch@1.9.0
Found: @picovoice/react-native-voice-processor@undefined
node_modules/@picovoice/react-native-voice-processor
  @picovoice/react-native-voice-processor@"^3.0.4" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @picovoice/react-native-voice-processor@">= 1.2.3" from @picovoice/porcupine-react-native@3.0.5
node_modules/@picovoice/porcupine-react-native
  @picovoice/porcupine-react-native@"^3.0.4" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
