# npm resolution error report

While resolving: snitch@1.9.1
Found: react@18.3.1
node_modules/react
  react@"^18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^19.1.1" from react-native@0.82.1
node_modules/react-native
  react-native@"^0.82.1" from the root project
  peer react-native@"^0.0.0-0 || >=0.60 <1.0" from @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.23.1
  node_modules/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage
    @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@"1.23.1" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
