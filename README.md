# Snitch

Prototype Expo app scaffold produced from the Codex CLI session. This repo only contains placeholder logic – wire it up to your actual wake-word detection, encrypted transport, and reporting APIs before relying on it in the field.

## Scripts

- `npm install` – install dependencies
- `npm run start` – start Expo dev server
- `npm run typecheck` – run TypeScript

Refer back to our pinned Codex conversation for the original requirements.
